# About

This is an application written in Node.js/Express that gets data from the Spotify API.

## Endpoints

1. `/artists/<artist name>` - gets the data about the artist by his/her name.
2. `/artist/<artist ID>/cities` - gets the first 50 cities where the artist is most played. You can get the `artist ID` on the first endpoint.
